# World Map Character Switcher

This mod lets you switch characters on the world map - both Adventure and Classic!

Change can be performed while standing on any tile, and pressing button bound to "Special". The map should then reload with the next character in order.

*Custom characters are not supported at this time. This feature will be added later.*

Its achieved by changing your character id, thus effectively convincing the game you always were playing this character.
